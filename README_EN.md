# Docker for Developers (with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes)

This project is a comprehensive Docker course, covering everything from basic concepts to advanced usage, including Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. The content includes container creation, images, and the use of Docker Compose, as well as container orchestration with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

## üî® Project Features

### Visual Example of the Project

This project allows you to create and orchestrate containers with Docker, using different orchestration methods such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. It also includes creating networks and volumes, along with an example of integration using Docker Compose.

- **Docker**: Containers, Images, Volumes, Networks, Bind Mounts.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestration of multiple containers.
- **Docker Swarm**: Orchestration of containers in a cluster.
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration of containers with Kubernetes clusters.
- **YAML**: Configuration definition for containers and services.
- **Flask**: Web framework for application container examples.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Project

To run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Make sure Node.js is installed**:
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is required to run the project. You can check if it is installed by running:

   ```bash
   node -v
   ```

- If not installed, download and install the recommended version.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Copy the repository URL and run the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```

## üåê Deploy

To deploy the project, you can use Docker, Docker Compose, or Kubernetes, as described in the configuration files.

### Deploy with Docker

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t image-name .
   ```

3. Run the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 image-name
   ```

### Deploy with Docker Compose

1. Navigate to the `5_compose/` directory.
2. Create and start the containers with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Deploy with Kubernetes

1. Navigate to the `6_kubernetes/` directory.
2. Start the Kubernetes service:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f flask-service.yaml
   ```

3. Access the service in your browser to view the running project.
